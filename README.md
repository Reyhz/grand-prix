# Grand Prix

NOT FINAL NAME

This is a prototype for a game idea I had recently

This game is a fast paced Racing Game using Deck Bulding and Procedural features, all in a 2D Top Down view !
The project is made using Godot 4.2

You can play the game on it's itch.io page that you can find in my [profile](reyhz.itch.io)

# Goal

I will use this project to learn how to make Procedural Elements ( Racing Tracks ), AI NPC, and try to learn Music and Graphics making !

I hope to publish it at least in a Prototype stage on itch
